# AnoGAN-MvTec(grid)

## Introduction

I only try to reconstruction texture samples in MvTec by AnoGAN, but not very successfully.

Even so, I still push my relative code with hopeness to help someone.

- My reconstruction results
- ![0-0](experiments\anogan_test\0-0.png)
- ![0-0](experiments\anogan_test\0-1.png)
- ![0-2](experiments\anogan_test\0-2.png)

## You Need Following Packages

pytorch；torchvision； opencv4 ；tensorboard； tensorflow(it's necessary if want use tensorbard )

torchsummary； numpy； tqdm； argparse； PIL

If you do not want install tensorboard and tensorflow, you can annotate relative code.

## Structure

- dataload
  - dataload.py get dataset
  - mvtec.py load images of mvtec
  - random_cut.py data argumentation by cutting sub-images randomly
- experiments save experiments results
  - size-64-epoch-100 pretrained weights when sub-images is 64*64 and epoches is 100
  - size-128-epoch-200 pretrained weights when sub-images is 128*128 and epoches is 200
  - anogan_train results during training
  - anogan_test results during testing(inference)
- models
  - CNN_anogan.py DCGAN with input size 128*128; if you want to train the model with input size 64*64, you need modify the model simply.
- runs save logs generated by tensorboard
- test infernece(testing) code
- train training code
